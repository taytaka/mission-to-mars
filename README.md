# Mission to Mars
The putpose of the project is to create a web app using BeautifulSoup, Splinter, and Mongo to showcase the most recent Mars news and updated images. Additionally, we want to showcase the four hemispheres of Mars by pulling images and their titles from the Mars Hemispheres website. Finally, we customized the web app to be unique.
